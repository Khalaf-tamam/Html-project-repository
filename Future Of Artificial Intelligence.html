        <h3> Artificial intelligence, robotics and the pursuit of autonomous systems that we can trust. Mark James wrote one of two articles on robotics and AI. .<br></br> He spent 30 years developing advanced software systems for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and is now the CTO of Beyond Limits, an AI engineering company in Southern California. Intelligence is a rare and valuable commodity. .<br></br>  From the octopus ’mysterious brain and ant colony ’s intelligence to playable deep learning machines and driverless vehicles, intelligence is the most powerful and precious resource available. Although the latest developments in artificial intelligence (AI) enable it to win races and drive cars, the opportunities for advanced technology to have a significant and beneficial impact on the world are numerous. .<br></br> This is especially true at the intersection of AI and robotics. Driven by three major trends, we are currently in a powerful new wave of AI. Computer capabilities are growing, algorithms and AI models are becoming more and more complex, and perhaps, most importantly, the world is generating unimaginable amounts of data. .<br></br>  Network equipment in almost every industry collects data in gigabytes every day. .<br></br>  As a result, from cars and medical equipment to robots and entertainment, artificial intelligence is almost closely integrated into all aspects of our lives. It stays here. His question is, how do we shape it? When pioneering technology is first introduced, it always attracts public attention.<br></br> For example, when no horse-drawn carriage appears on the streets of England, the flag bearer is required to walk ahead, so as not to scare the horses that are not about to be replaced. Today, many people have similar concerns about robots. .<br></br> Movies and Internet memes about overly intelligent robots have stirred people's concerns about machines destined to take over, but most people ignore robots that have affected their daily lives. .<br></br>  Who does n’t like the convenience of washing machines or dishwashers? They did all the tedious work for us, and they did so without complaint.</h3>
