        <h1> Breief Of AI </h1>
  <h3>Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of digital computers or computer-controlled robots to perform tasks normally associated with intelligent creatures. The term is commonly used in the development of system projects with intellectual characteristics of human characteristics, such as reasoning ability, discovery of meaning, generalization ability, or learning from past experience. Since the development of digital computers in the 1940s, it has been proven that computers can be programmed to perform very complex tasks very skillfully, such as discovering proofs of mathematical theorems or playing chess. Nonetheless, despite the increasing processing speed and storage capacity of computers, there is no program that can be compared with human flexibility in a wider field or in tasks that require a lot of daily knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have reached the performance level of human experts and professionals when performing certain tasks, so this kind of limited can be found in various applications such as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and speech or handwriting recognition Artificial intelligence in the sense.</h3>
