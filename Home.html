      <h3><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072215/investors-turn-artificial-intelligence.asp">Artificial intelligence</a>(AI) is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks normally associated with intelligent creatures.<br></br> Refers to the simulation of human intelligence in a machine that is programmed to think like humans and imitate its behavior. .<br></br> The term can also be applied to any machine that exhibits features related to human thinking (such as learning and problem solving). .<br></br> The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that are most likely to achieve specific goals.</h3>
<h1><u>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</u></h1>
<h3>
When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of is a robot. That's because large-budget movies and novels weave stories about humanoid machines that destroy the earth. However, the truth is still far from the truth. <br></br>Artificial intelligence is based on the principle that artificial intelligence can be defined in such a way that a machine can easily imitate it and perform tasks from the simplest to the most complex. <br></br> The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning and perception. As technology advances, the benchmarks that previously defined artificial intelligence have become obsolete. <br></br> For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character recognition are no longer embodied as artificial intelligence, because this function is now regarded as an inherent computer function. <br></br>The continuous development of artificial intelligence has benefited many different industries. Use interdisciplinary methods based on mathematics, computer science, linguistics, psychology, etc. to connect machines.</h3>
