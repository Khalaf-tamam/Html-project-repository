        <ul> <h1><u>Advantages</u></h1>
            <h3>
            <li> Artificial intelligence can be used in mining or other exploration processes. The machines and robots used in this field are so complex that they can be used to explore the seabed. Intelligent robots can also be sent to explore space because they are made of metal and are more difficult to maintain in space.</li>
 <br></br><li> Smart phones are simple examples of how we use AI in our daily lives. We are using GPS for travel, using virtual assistants such as Siri, taking pictures and detecting human faces, etc.</li>
 <br></br><li> The machine's thinking speed is faster than humans, and it can easily perform multi-tasking. Therefore, these machines are used to perform some more dangerous tasks.</li>    
 <br></br><li>The games we play are actually made by artificial intelligence. The machine inside the computer will plan the game and its actions in return for our actions. </li>
 <br></br><li> Doctors use AI to easily detect certain diseases or health risks. Moreover, even during surgery, doctors can also use artificial intelligence. Robots are often used to treat mental illness, and they can help people fight depression</li>
 <br></br><li>AI machines can predict what users will search, ask, and type, and can also recommend some actions based on user needs. They replaced people in many tasks. Moreover, they have no emotions when thinking, which is why they make the right decision without making mistakes.</li> 
 <br></br><li>Artificial intelligence supports virtual teaching, meetings, learning, and connects people all over the world. .</li>
 <br></br><li>Artificial intelligence developed machine translation. Of course, it cannot be as accurate and precise as human translation, but in some cases, it can be a faster and more effective solution. .</li>
 <br></br><li>After correct programming, the machine will not make mistakes like humans. They are processing data without errors, regardless of their size.</li>.
</h3></ul>
<ul> <h1><u>Disadvantages</u></h1>
    <h3> <li>Artificial intelligence is replacing many skilled jobs, and this is how some people will lose their jobs. For example, many robots have completed work on the assembly line. In addition, there are these new types of driverless cars that can replace millions of human drivers, such as taxi or bus drivers.</li>
        <br></br> <li> AI is very expensive. Only well-funded schools can allow themselves to use artificial intelligence and make money from it. If the robot is repaired or rebuilt, it may also cost a lot of money and resources.</li>
        <br></br><li> People are increasingly addicted to smartphones and their functions, so they often forget their intelligence. AI technology can help you in creative design, but because they don't have a human brain, they  can't suggest you how to be creative.</li>
        <br></br> <li> If AI falls into the wrong hands, it may be used as a dangerous weapon and cause big problems. It is easy for people to lose control of technology and cause danger</li>
        <li>Like humans, experience cannot improve artificial intelligence. The way they store data is very different from human intelligence.</li></h3>
