        <h3>The first patent for the invention of the telephone took place in 1876, and AI was later introduced. To be precise, the field of artificial intelligence research was established at a seminar held on the campus of Dartmouth College in the summer of 1956. At the time, it was predicted that machines as intelligent as humans would no longer exist. They received millions of dollars to realize this vision.</h3>

        <h3>In the first few decades of the 21st century, investment and interest in AI increased. Since then, machine learning has been successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to the existence of powerful computers.</h3>

<h2>1950 – The time when it all started</h2>
<h3>So now this concept has existed for decades, but it was not until 1950 that people realized the word. As we all know, the founder of artificial intelligence John McCarthy (John McCarthy) introduced the term "artificial intelligence" in 1955. McCarthy, along with Alan Turing, Alan Newell, Herbert Simon and Marvin Minsky, is known as the founder of AI. Alan suggested that if people use available information and reasoning to solve problems and make decisions, why can't they do it with machines? .</h3>
<h2>1974 – Computers flourished! </h2>
<h3>As time passed, the computer wave began. Over time, they have become faster, more affordable and able to store more information. The best part is that they can think abstractly, be able to identify themselves and achieve success  Natural Language Processing. .</h3>
<h2>1980 – The year of AI</h2>
<h3>In 1980, artificial intelligence research was encouraged with the expansion of funding and algorithmic tools. Through deep learning technology, computers can learn from user experience. .</h3>
<h2>2000’s – Landed to the Landmark</h2>
<h3>After all failed attempts, the technology was successfully established, but it was not until the 2000s that the epoch-making goal was achieved. At that time, despite the lack of government funds and public attention, artificial intelligence was still booming.</h3>
